## About

My name is Alberto and I’m a coder enthusiast, currently working as a Software Engineer specialized in Machine Learning at Google.

I graduated with a Master in Computer Science from ETH Zürich in 2018. Previously, I was part of the CFIS program of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), from which I earned a double Bachelor in Telecommunications and Industrial Engineering. In addition, as an undergraduate student I gained some working experience at the startup Verse Technologies, where I contributed to develop a mobile application aimed to make instant payments.

I have a strong interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which were the subjects of my bachelor thesis at the Image Processing Group of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Furthermore, during my Master’s Thesis I had the chance to keep using these topics at the Computer Vision Lab of ETH Zürich, where I worked on Video Object Segmentation.

Always curious about the present technologies, but also excited about what awaits us in the years to come, I keep thinking that "the best way to predict your future is to create it".
