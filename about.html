## About

My name is Alberto and I’m a coder enthusiast. I studied a double Bachelor degree in Telecommunications and Industrial Engineering in Barcelona. During the last year, I also worked in the startup Verse Technologies as a Backend Developer. I helped them to release and grow the product in the early stages developing the backend of an application to easily send money through your mobile phone.

One of my main topics of interest (in addition to coding) is Machine Learning and Deep Learning which I started working with on my Bachelor Thesis. A year ago I started coursing the Master in Computer Science at ETH Zürich specializing in this topics. Nowadays I’m finishing my Master Thesis on the Computer Vision Lab about Video Object Segmentation with Prof. Luc van Gol.
